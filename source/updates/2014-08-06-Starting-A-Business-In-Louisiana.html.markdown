Itemized deductions are usually personal in nature, and don’t include business expenses (although they do include job expenses). Some of the more common ones are:

medical and dental expenses
state and local income taxes, or sales tax
real estate and personal property taxes
home mortgage and investment interest
charitable contributions
casualty and theft losses
job expenses, and
miscellaneous deductions for such things as investment expenses, hobby expenses, gambling losses, and tax preparation fees.
The largest of these deductions are those for home mortgage interest, property taxes, and state income tax. For this reason, homeowners usually itemize, while renters often do not.

However, most of these expenses cannot be deducted in full. Instead, they are subject to special limitations—for example, medical expenses can be deducted only to the extent that they exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income (AGI), and job expenses to the extent they exceed 2% of AGI. Consequently, you may find that few or none of your personal expenses are deductible.
