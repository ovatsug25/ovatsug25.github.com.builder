Not too long

Steve Jobs famoulsy said, "A-people hire A-people, B-people hire C-people,
C-people hire D-people and the business goes downhill from there."

I've long wondered who the A-people were. On the surface, you would think
that the smartest most capabale people are the A people. This checks out,
smart people want to talk to smart people. Only the smart people can
identify those who are the same.

However, on a more nuanced level, I've seen plenty of extremeley smart, capable
people crushing partner ambitions, hoggning resoucres and destroying teams.
Extreme talent is sometimes said to strive for isolation, breaking away from
the partnerships on which most businesses succeed.

A-People thus, are defined not so much by a talent as they are by an attitude.
They are willing to let others take the spotlight because they are secure in
their contribuitions. They will push those who can make the best contributions.

They are willing to put the extra time and energy that might be required of them
to match the contribuitons of the presently more-talented.

A-people are Attitude-people then. They can handle nuance, they can handle
skill-gaps, they can push people along. They are willing to wait to become better.

B-people are be-the-best-people. They may be as talented, or even more
talented than their A-rank peers, but because they want to be the best now
and always, they will compromise the team in their efforts
to get more and more credit for their efforts.

A-people and B-people boil down not to talent, but to emotional
intelligence. Talents sort people in another way, but not into A and B.
