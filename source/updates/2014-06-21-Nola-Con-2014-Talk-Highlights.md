“Ideas are raw material”
“Mistaking execution for creatiivity”
“Epiphany is the human superpower”

My general feeling throughout his talk:
Overall awesome guy doing awesome things.
I took issue however with the


Ben Miller: Why you are pwned and you just don’t now it
“Protect, Protect, Protect”strategy VS “Detect, Respond, Contain”
“You’re probably already breached.” (Confirmed by Brian Foster later)


Conversation with Paul Asadoorian
Embedded devices operate on very low memory footprint and binaries are easy to reverse. (Never saw this before!)
These devices are everywhere: toilets, showers, fridge, and so on.

Brian Foseter: Do you have enough execuitioners?
Key quotes:
“We don’t mind publicly releasing our methods because they are worthless without the data we feed them”
“We see somewhere around 50% of all North American traffic.”
Operate sort of like Google: Crawl for infected devices, Identify types of threats, Rank them by priority
A few companies have around 97 infected boxes daily

Brandon Niemczyk: Probabilistic detection of malware infected hosts via DNS query analysis
