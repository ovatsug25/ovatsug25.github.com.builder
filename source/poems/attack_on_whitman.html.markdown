Attack on Whitman
==
Word’s worth, to be judged not on the printed page
But when spoken, so as to hear, their jar.
Taken by the structure, which is not a cage
For the mind of the strong. Avoid the tar

Of that weak man Whitman, potholes
Which he covered, laying waste to the music
The clatter, the sound, constructed by cryptic calls
And the careful placement of words, poe-tricks.

Say not that your ramble is worthy, babbler
For it is but the farting of a child. Diaper
that mouth together! Go home straggler
You are a liar—venomous—slithering viper..

To be true, one’s verse needs structure,
Without it you deprave our culture, puncture.
