Drugs
pump drugs into system hardcore.
plans to forget the night,
sometime confused as to who this is for
thinking, not just staring at light.

trip into our own private world,
or something, beyond and distant,
not recognizable, part of the gnarled
bark of the tree, reliable assistant

of joy. a hovercraft over those issues
we face, but sometimes need a break
from. daily coffee replaced by occasional tiramisu
its not like weâ€™re eating straight sheet cake

just dont let it become a habit,
only wear the jacket in the winter
