[Wish List](/melissa/wish-list.html)


The Why {#why}
--------------

I needed a car.
I've always loved cars, and as the heavens had it a relatively cheap,
good condition manual transmission was offered.
She was beautiful sure-though perhaps a little rough around the edges.
As I got to know her though, I began to appreciate her deep simplicity, and
from her learned what a car was.

The Purchase {#the-purchase}
----------------------------

First off: Here's the Craigslist ad for her.

How to Drive {#how-to-drive-stick}
----------------------------------

Once I got her, I needed to learn how to drive her. My friend Angelica helped
me get her home. Once I got her home though I was on my own.
It took me a bit and it was a little Scary, but I finally learned how to
drive a manual transmission.

Read more about that here[/melissa/manual-trans.html].

Looking Beautiful {#looking-beautiful}
--------------------------------------

Now Melissa needed a little bit of work. But before I ever got to work
on her, I needed to know how she looked. I needed to learn how to beautify
her. In the car world, this is called washing and detailing.

Larry Kosilla from Ammo NYC explains these in a beautiful set of videos.
Here are my favorites:

[Include Larry Kosilla video's]

His products are a little expensive however. Here's a list of the one's
I purchased for my car:


#### Exterior Chemicals
Optimum (NR2010Q) No Rinse Wash & Shine - 32 oz.
Speedy Surface Prep - Fine Grade
Chemical Guys WAC_CLY_100 - Luber - Clay & Clay Block Synthetic Lubricant & Detailer (1 Gal)
Optimum Car Wax
Optimum (ID2008P) Instant Detailer & Gloss Enhancer - 17 oz.
303 Products 30650 High Tech Fabric Guard with Water Repellant - 32 oz.
Rain-X Glass Treatment Trigger

#### Exterior Tools
2 of Meguiar's X3002 Microfiber Wash Mitt
Meguiar's X3070 Soft Foam 4" Applicator Pads - (Pack of 2)
Chemical Guys MIC_292_08 - Premium Grade Microfiber Applicator (Pack of 8)


#### Interior Chemicals
Meguiar's G10916 Gold Class Rich Leather Cleaner & Conditioner - 15.2 oz.
Leather Conditioner & Restorer - Leather Nova
Meguiar's G13616 Quik Interior Detailer Cleaner - 16 oz.

#### Interior Tools
TEKTON 7063 Detail Brush Set, 5-Piece
AES Industries 10-1/2" Automotive Cleaning Brush w/ Dense Solvent Resistant Hog Hair Bristles
Detail Cleaning Brush
Lisle 14000 Parts Cleaning Brush
Carrand 97372AS Interior Duster

AAA 4326AAA Heavy Duty 16' 6 Gauge Booster Cable
Joes Racing 32307 (0-60) PSI Tire Pressure Gauge
High Road TrashStand Leakproof Car Litter Basket - XLarge

### Key Point when using high end chemicals
Lift it up, wash it away
VS
Grind it in

Lift it up by agitating it into the foam.
Scrubbing with a brush, vs griding with a flat surface.
Scratches and swirls are most commonly caused by improper car washing
and care.

#### With Quality Rinse Away Paint:
Three Ammo Foam squits
Squirt pad
Squirt bucket
2 bucket method

* For black cars put it inside of pressure washer



When there water on the car, how do you remove that safely?

Manufacturing chemicals is more expensive the fewer things
that are in there.
Car love marks.
Teddy bear squeeze.



### Leather Repair

As well, I've looked into leather repair, and so far I've tried these:

http://www.leathermagic.com/Pages/ProProds.htm
http://www.leatherrepairkits.com/repairkit.php

#### Interior Chemicals
Meguiar's G10916 Gold Class Rich Leather Cleaner & Conditioner - 15.2 oz.
Leather Conditioner & Restorer - Leather Nova

The leather defitinley feels softer and more supple. It works. The question
is whether it is too cracked. Can I fix it, or is a reuploshtery worth it?

This is a little bit more expensive. But I hope to be able to get her
looking real good on the inside.


Addendum: Some reviewers have noted that Leather Honey didn't soak in to whatever they were treating, leaving it sticky. Certain leathers, mainly car upholstery and couches, are surface treated with a urethane topcoat. It doesn't make it feel like plastic, so you can't easily tell by rubbing it. Try putting a drop of water in an unobtrusive spot. If the water doesn't soak in and "wet" the leather within a minute, don't use Leather Honey! Bick 4 will work, though you will be wiping most of it away. What I use is 303 Aerospace Protectant for leathers that are coated to the point that they don't absorb water. Note, however, that 303 makes the leather more slick. Not badly so, but try it first. (303 is great stuff anyway for anything plastic or rubber or teak, but that's another review ...)0

Finally, how do I get her running.

#### BMW E30 Specific
http://www.r3vlimited.com/board/showthread.php?t=159148



### Tools {#tools}

#### Minimum
A set of metric combination wrenches
1/4" and 3/8" ratchets
Metric sockets, regular and deep
Metric "Allen" (hex) bit sockets and/or wrenches
Torx bit sockets and/or screwdrivers
Screwdrivers
Jackstands
Jack

#### Nice to haves
torque wrench
impact drill
100 gal air compressor.

#### Last considerations
To the previous lists I would add:
- A second torque wrench (so you have a large and small)
- Breaker bar, an 18" or better yet 24" if you will be doing suspension work
- A set of large 1/2" impact sockets for the large torque wrench and breaker bar
- Set of various size and length socket extensions
- Set of various size socket universal joints
- Inexpensive digital micrometer (brakes)
- Inexpensive multimeter

All of which you can get cheaply, or not, depending on your budget.

Some good brands to consider are Gearwrench; JH Williams; Snap-on; SK Hand Tool

Car Tuning {#car-tuning}
------------------------

The chip is the only one on your list that will provide you with any
real gains. Even modded M20's don't make over 200 Hp.
I've often said the way to make a M20 faster is Chip, Shift, Diff.
Get a chip, get a short shifter if it's a manual, and swap the differential,
beyond that your wasting money

You need to concentrate on the handling of the car rather than going fast,
if you want a fast car consider turbo, engine swaps or selling it.
You should be able to find a 92 or later 325i or 525i with the M50 engine
in a junk yard and perform a complete bolt-in engine swap
for less than $1500 if you do the work yourself.
