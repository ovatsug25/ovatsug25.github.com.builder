Hylotron? Where did that even come from! How is it related to dragonfruit.

Behold the answer here:

The Dragonfruit, also known as Pitaya, Huo Long Guo, or really freaking
cool looking edible is known to biologists as the Hylocerus.

Because I'm technologically inclined and wanted to stay away from
a dinosaur, I chose Hylotron.

Very simple.

Now enjoy my collection of fruit!
